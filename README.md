## Field-Bounded Crop Type Classification
Crop type classification is an established application of satellite remote sensing, able to map continental scales of agriculture with a vast pool of satellite data and relatively few ground reference points required for a reasonably accurate product. Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines are commonly deployed as ML methods for the classifications.

Most 'classic' methods approach classification pixel-by-pixel. Smoothing and filtering windows may be applied *post-hoc* to map more homogeneous fields. While these methods are often satisfactory for large-area classifications, accuracy expectations typically top-out at 80-85%.
